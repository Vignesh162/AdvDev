Download Terraform:

Go to the Terraform download page.
Download the appropriate .zip file for Windows.
Extract the Zip File:

Extract the contents of the .zip file. You will find a single executable file named terraform.exe.
Move the Executable:

Move terraform.exe to a directory included in your system's PATH (e.g., C:\Windows\System32 or create a new folder like C:\Terraform).
To create a new folder:
Press Win + R, type cmd, and press Enter.
Run the following command:
bash
Copy code
mkdir C:\Terraform
Move the file using File Explorer or the command line.
Verify the Installation:

Open a new command prompt and run:

mkdir terraform-ec2-instance
cd terraform-ec2-instance

Create a file named main.tf:

bash
Copy code
touch main.tf
Open main.tf in your favorite text editor and add the following configuration to define an EC2 instance:

hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"  # Specify your preferred region
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Replace with a valid AMI ID for your region
  instance_type = "t2.micro"  # Choose your instance type

  tags = {
    Name = "MyTerraformInstance"
  }
}
Note: Make sure to replace the AMI ID with one that is valid for your chosen region. You can find AMI IDs in the AWS EC2 console under "AMIs."
